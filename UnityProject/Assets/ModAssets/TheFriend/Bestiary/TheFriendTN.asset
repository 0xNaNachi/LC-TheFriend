    Scientific
    name: Imperatore Putrescere

    

    There has been nothing like it ever
    since the dawn of time. It seems to be sentient enough to be able to toy with
    us.

    It has a black, oily body and apart from the humanoid features and
    the tendril-like protrusions from his head, his most prominent feature might
    be the glowing, red face featuring a euphoric expression, almost as if it takes
    pleasure in robbing the souls of countless employees.

    It is advised to
    steer clear of it whenever possible. Nothing more can be said about it.'
